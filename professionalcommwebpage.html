     <h1>Comm 3214 with Ms. Quesenberry</h1>
     <p>This has been one of my most useful classes at Virginia Tech. It has helped me perfect my resume, learn how to approach and interview and how to work with others. It is very practical for uses in college and after college. This class also requires you interview professionals which can get you a professional connection to work with in your field. We also had guest speakers to help with time management and how to be a professional. I would recommend this class to all students at Virginia Tech as it has helped me tremendously. </p>
